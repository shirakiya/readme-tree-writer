│   ├── README.md
│   ├── dir1
│   │   └── file
│   └── dir2
│       └── file
└── dir2
    ├── README.md
    └── file
```

- `./dir1/README.md`

````
# Tree

```
.
├── README.md
├── dir1
│   └── file
└── dir2
    └── file

```

````

- `./dir2/README.md`

````
# Tree

```
.
├── README.md
└── file
```

````
